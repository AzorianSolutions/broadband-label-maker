# broadband-labeler
This project contains a simple tool for generating FCC mandated broadband consumer labels.

The project demo can be found at [https://bblmaker.com](https://bblmaker.com).

## Installation

To set up the project locally, you will need to have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) installed.

In order to deploy the project locally or on a server, run the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/AzorianSolutions/broadband-label-maker.git
cd broadband-label-maker
source bin/install.sh
```

Once this has been completed, you should have all the dependencies necessary to run the project from
the local file system or a web server.

If you are running the project locally, you can just open src/index.html in your choice of browser.

If you are running the project from a web server, you should configure the web root of your server to
point to the `src` directory.
